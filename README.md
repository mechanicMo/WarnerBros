Hello! Thanks for checking out my mock site for Warner Bros!


What I have implemented / used:
- simple search results
- firebase database with mock data for movies, tv shows, games & apps
- axios to retrieve data
- responsive down to width of 350px (iphone 6: 375px, galaxy s5: 360px)
- filter options for MOVIES page
- bootstrap for the dropdown menus on movies page

What I have NOT implemented:
- a way to change how items are displayed (row vs grid)
- data for blog, other
- filter options for tv shows, games & apps, "all" page, etc.
- the responsiveness is currently covering every use case (including the filter bar - try playing with it as much as possible and let me know if i missed anything) - but it's currently causing some lagginess if you do change the screen size frequently (not a likely user case, but something that I noticed in my testing). I have not addressed this in this version of the project


To begin, clone or download this project...

Then, please navigate into the root of the project directory and run the following to use the site

----- Everything below here is the default readme from `npx create-react-app` -----




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
